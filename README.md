# Lecture notes on Analytic Number Theory III

This is my TeXed version of Prof. Schindler's lecture notes for her lecture on analytic number theory, held in the winter term 2023/24. To work with the tex files you will need my custom package *dntex*, which you can find [here](https://github.com/DalistNirgendwo/dntex) and install manually.
